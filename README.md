## notes

`pomodoro_timer` is a time management cli app

---

### what functionality do I want?

* cli app with basic arguments I can pass to it:
    * pomodoro - 25 minutes of work time;
    * short break - 5 minutes break;
    * long break - 10 minutes break;
* when the timer finishes, I want to hear some kind of notification ('\a' or some kind of music);
* maybe a possibility to change the notification sound;
* all kinds of time statistics for this day (time spent working/breaking, periods of time spent working/breaking, etc.);
* the same statistics for 7 days;
* the app should utilize the user's pc clock;
* my app should be a fully working linux cli app;
* I guess that's it for now;
